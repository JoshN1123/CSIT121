    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Top Boy is one of the best shows I’ve ever watched. The way they immerse you in this fictional story is incredible, they make you feel what the characters feel. Even though this story is fictional, they make you connect with these characters like they were your close friends. Not only this, but they constantly do things that you’ll never even think of to further enrich and complicate the plot line of the series. </p>
